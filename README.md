# Pindery
**Pindery** is an Android based social network designed to join and organize **parties**, mainly geared towards low-level student events.
Each user will have the possibility to generate a ‘new party’ or join already existing ones nearby.
The exchange of money will be replaced by a **point-based** system which will fairly divide the expenses for each party between the guests, who bring the necessary stuff. So **don't worry** about spending money and never getting payed back or buying everything!
A review system will also be implemented both towards the party organizers and the guests, in order to give reliability to the users.
To promote the creation of new events, ‘party-organizers’ will be **awarded points** for successful parties, so that they won't need to buy stuff to take part to other parties.
